# Technical Documentation Generation Process

## Overview
Each time a team onboards their project to the Depo Dev Portal, our system automatically generates and publishes technical documentation for that project.
This process ensures that all relevant information is up-to-date and easily accessible for developers and stakeholders.

## Features Added
- automated the process of generating and publishing technical documentation for all DSB projects
that are onboarded with our Depo Dev Portal application by processing and displaying the changes on them
- fixed displaying GitHub Images from markdown files used by developers in their own projects documentation
