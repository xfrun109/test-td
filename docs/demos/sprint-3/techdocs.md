# Technical Documentation Generation Process

## üìñ Overview
Each time a team onboards their project to the Depo Dev Portal, our system automatically generates and publishes technical documentation for that project.
This process ensures that all relevant information is up-to-date and easily accessible for developers and stakeholders.

## üéÇ Features Added
- automated the process of generating and publishing technical documentation for all DSB projects
that are onboarded with our Depo Dev Portal application by processing and displaying the changes on them
- fixed displaying GitHub Images from markdown files used by developers in their own projects documentation

## ‚è±Ô∏è Ideas for Future Improvements
- Additional Standard Project Documentation processing for TechDocs that can be found [here](https://jira.dsb.dk/browse/IN-1664):
