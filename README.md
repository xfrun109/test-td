# Frantz - ROOT/README.md

This content was generated based on the `root/README.md` without using `docs/index.md`.

# Headings
Root level content.

## A second-level heading
Some 2nd level content.

### A third-level heading
Some 3rd level content.

# Links
Below you can find some sample test cases that contain some links:

- This a sample [relative link](relative_link.md) in the same root directory: `relative_link.md`;
- Another test case is [another relative link](sub/sub_relative_link.md) that is found in a subdirectory of the repository ROOT directory: `sub/sub_relative_link.md`;
- Sample [absolute link](https://www.dsb.dk) pointing to a great resource :bullettrain_side::train::train:.

# Lists

## Simple Lists using -, * and +
Below are some possible improvements
- custom styles are possible (eg: paddings for heading which are disturbing right now, colors, etc)
* either on the left (nav) or on the right side automatic generation of content for heading is possible based on code only; so no need for the repository owners to do anything
+ ...more ideas will come in the future as we nagivate more and discover new things w/[Backsatge](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/)

## Nested Lists
